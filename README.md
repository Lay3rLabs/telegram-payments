# Telegram Payments

This is an entry for [Hackmos: Cosmoverse 2025](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/hackmos-2025/detail)

It shows a [WAVS Service](https://www.wavs.xyz) that uses a decentralized operator set to bridge Telegram and Cosmsos.
These operators manage a Telegram bot and trigger on-chain payments when a user requests this from the bot.
They also monitor the users account and can send a Telegram message anytime the user receives a payment.
