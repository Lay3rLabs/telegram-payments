# Bot Setup

Go through the normal setup, once you have it, make sure you do the following:

`/setcommands` to set the commands for the bot:

```
status - Show registration status of your account
receive - Register your account to receive payments
send - Initiate a transfer to another telegram user
help - Get help and usage information
```

`setjoingroups` - Disable (for now until we test it)

`/newapp` to create a mini-app for this bot
